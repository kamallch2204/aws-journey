# Day 5 — AWS Lambda

- Understood what AWS Lambda is (serverless, event-driven compute)
- Created a basic Node.js Lambda function
- Learned about handler structure (`exports.handler`)
- Tested the function using the Lambda console
- Explored triggers (API Gateway, S3, EventBridge)
- Saw how CloudWatch logs automatically capture output/errors.
